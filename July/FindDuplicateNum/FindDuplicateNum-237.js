// Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

// There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

// You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

// google question

var findDuplicate = function(nums) {

    
};


console.log(findDuplicate([1,3,4,2,2]));
